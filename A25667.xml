            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thou may≈øt as well a≈ø≈øert that God di≈øpens'd with the Jews to keep the Sabbath day, that they ≈øhould not celebrate the Fea≈øts of the Gentiles, as ≈øay, That he di≈øpens'd with Swearing by his Name to keep them from Swearing by Idols, or from the Idolatrous Wor≈øhip of the Heathen Gods; the former as well as the later (though both be frivolous) may be averred. And upon this account it would be as great a ≈øin for Chri≈øtians to keep the Sabbath, as to ≈øwear in any

            <p>Now if he can prove by any evidence out of the Go≈øpel or Evangeli≈øts, that to Swear is a ≈øin in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature (with which the Jews, as he fal≈øly a≈ø≈øerts, were di≈øpens'd by God) if he can do this (which I know is impo≈ø≈øible) I will recant what I have writ, and exhort all my Friends and good Chri≈øtians not to Swear at all.</p>
            <p>I am confident that the Author of the Treati≈øe was ≈øtartled, and put to a ≈øtaining blu≈øh when he peru≈øed St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Glo≈øs upon our Saviour's words, and met with his <note n="*" place="margin">Con≈øidera quod hic Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator per De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um jurare non prohibuerit.</note>

                  <hi>If any one who is</hi> Noble, <hi>and a</hi> Peer <hi>of the Realm be ≈øued in</hi> Chancery, <hi>he ought to an≈øwer upon his</hi> Oath; <hi>and, if any Noble per≈øon be produced as a witne≈øs between party and party, he ought to be ≈øworn, or otherwi≈øe his Testimony is of no value; in the≈øe ca≈øes his atte≈øtation, or</hi> Avouchment upon his Honour <hi>will not be admitted, though in many others it may and ought to be accepted.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, I mu≈øt in lieu of his <hi>Propo≈øal</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> propound a Que≈øtion to him, which is, whether the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Lords</hi> both <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> committed an hainous ≈øin, when his <hi>Maje≈øty at his Coronation,</hi> bound him≈øelf (by a gracious conde≈øcen≈øion) in an <hi>Oath</hi> to di≈øcharge faithfully that great Tru≈øt for the wellfare of the Church and State committed by God unto him, and they likewi≈øe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them≈øelves by a reciprocal <hi>Oath</hi> to be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> to him, with this clo≈øe, <hi>So help me God,</hi> hereby invocating God to be a <hi>Witne≈øs</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> of what they had ≈øworn, and de≈øiring no help or mercy from him, if they ≈øhould ever rebell again≈øt their <hi>King?</hi> Dares the <hi>Treati≈øt</hi> or his <hi>Fellow-Quakers</hi> ≈øay that they ≈øinned or broke Chri≈øt's command by doing it? I pre≈øume they dare not, nay they cannot, without being guilty of a lye; and to ≈øay that it is a ≈øin to invocate or call upon God, is no le≈øs than bla≈øphemy. From hence I infer, that their general <hi>The≈øis,</hi> to wit, <hi>That it is not lawful to Swear in any ca≈øe,</hi> is ab≈øurd, fal≈øe, and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>So it is likewi≈øe of a dangerous <hi>Con≈øequence,</hi> as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ≈øubver≈øion of Order, the de≈øtruction of good
